# Note from the Author Jayson Rivers,
 im currently working on a massive update/rewrite to this
 with 20 categories of more extensive repair/convenience 
 options. It is much more comprehensive and will be open source
 and freely available right here, when its finished.*Update..already finished coding the 20 modules now I just need to test it before uploading, it will support expensive repairs and utilities across Network Management, Package Management, User Management, Power Management, Kernel Management, Nvidia GPU Management, Sytemlogs Management, Partition Management, Mount/Unmount Management, Shell Configuration Management, System File Corruption Management, Backup Management, Desktop Management(lightdm,kdm,gdm,etc), Permission Management, Services Management, Linux Headers Management, FlashDrive Format Management, Device Management, System Information Management and last but not least, A Tweaks Section with speccial customizations and shortcuts. This comes from 4 years of noticing common problems and a great number of approaches to diagnosing and reparing problems in these areas, and at times doing the wrong thing and having to reinstall linux. Dozens of hours of my life spent just keeping linux going and running smooth, so this is what I have come up with to help avoid that and help others. stay tuned for the major overhaul and epic Kali Linux Repair tool, Which I will publish a release for.
