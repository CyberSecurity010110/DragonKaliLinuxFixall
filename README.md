# As Promised Here is the major update I promised but be warned, the interface works and most buttons, but it is not tested well. expect some 
# things not to work yet, and others not work as expected. In testing I used every button and kali not load next time. Kali is very finicky with repairs
# and as I have time Ill debug and test stuff, enhance stuff, and to it. So for now im adding the huge amount of modules I promised and urge to use backups
# I reccomend Timeshift, its very easy and fast. removing published release to ensure its not too easy to use and breakyour system with.
